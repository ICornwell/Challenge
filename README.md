Adventure!

Console based adventure game!

use `yarn start` or `npm start` to run

Challenge:

This is the beginnings of an adventure game, and an adventure game framework - designed to seperate the actual game assets and logic from a basic technical game engine.

What are the 'good' aspects of this design?
What are the 'poor' apects of this design?

How can we create game-asset specific extensions to the command/input interpreter (so games can have special commands/inputs that relate to specific items/rooms)

We'd like to make the game multi-user - how could do this, what would need to be changed / added

How could we introduce non-player-charactors with conversational interactions

What alternatives are there to using regex for the command/input interpretaions - what NPM libraries might be useful here
